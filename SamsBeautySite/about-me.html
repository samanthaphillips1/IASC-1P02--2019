			<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

			<p style="color: gray; font-family: 'Solway', serif">Ever since I was young, I always had a passion for the beauty industry. I began experimenting with different makeup/nail/hair looks in sixth grade. Throughout high school, my peers would always ask me to do their makeup for them for our school dances. I never realized how much I actually enjoyed doing others' nails, hair and makeup until I was in Univeristy. This then became my deciding factor to do makeup on the side while I go to school and continue my undergrad for French Studies.</p>
